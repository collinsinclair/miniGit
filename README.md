# miniGit

A Mini Version Control System

Authors: Collin Sinclair and Linnea Wolniewicz

Spring 2021 term project for CSCI 2270: Data Structures at the University of Colorado Boulder

This is a working miniature version control system. It creates a local repository, /miniGit, and allows you to interact directly with your repository through the terminal. You may add and remove files from your current working directory, commit changes, or even checkout previous commits.

This code is compiled by typing the command 'g++ -std=c++17 driver.cpp miniGit.cpp -o miniGit', and can be run with the command './miniGit'. You will then be greeted by a menu of options, where you can create files in your current working directory and commit changes locally. 

We are very proud of this project and hope you enjoy it as well!
